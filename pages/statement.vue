      <span class="animate-text">EVERY DAY YOU WAIT, YOU LOSE CUSTOMERS.</span
      ><br />
      <span class="animate-text"
        >They click your ad, visit your site… then disappear.</span
      ><br />
      <span class="animate-text"
        >Maybe they didn't trust the product. Maybe the message didn't
        hit.</span
      ><br />
      <span class="animate-text">Maybe they just forgot.</span><br />
      <span class="animate-text">Either way, they're gone.</span><br />
      <span class="animate-text">And every day, it keeps happening.</span><br />
      <span class="animate-text">Thousands in lost revenue.</span><br />
      <span class="animate-text"
        >Hundreds of customers slipping away. Competitors?</span
      ><br />
      <span class="animate-text"
        >They're scaling to an extra $50K, even $100K a month.</span
      ><br />
      <span class="animate-text">Now imagine your brand instead:</span><br />
      <span class="animate-text"
        >Your ads pull in the right customers because your messaging actually
        connects.</span
      ><br />
      <span class="animate-text"
        >Your customers stay because they feel like part of a real
        community.</span
      ><br />
      <span class="animate-text"
        >Sales come in daily because AI-powered interactions convert at the
        right time.</span
      ><br />
      <span class="animate-text">This is what we do at Godspeed.</span><br />
      <span class="animate-text"
        >We don't just run ads. We fix the entire system — so your brand scales
        fast and stays growing.</span

      <span class="animate-text">How much are you losing by waiting?</span>
